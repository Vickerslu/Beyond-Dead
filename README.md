# Beyond Dead
Beyond Dead is a top-down shooter. 

A brave adventurer wakes up on an unexplored planet after colliding with a meteor. The ship looks fixable, but they must collect resources from the planet to get back up and running. 

However, they are not alone...

Zombie-like creatures inhabit the planet and are hoarding materials, and they're not keen on sharing- or visitors for that matter!

Maybe if they can get these materials from them, they could bring them back to the crash site and fix the ship.
